= Introduction =

Getting a Crystal analysis going can seem daunting, but it's actually quite easy. The wiki covers lots of topics; this page provides some high-level guidance and checkpoints to make sure things worked out ok.

Instructors can use each step as a checkpoint to make sure that students aren't lost, or students can follow this themselves to prevent silly mistakes.

= 1. Install Crystal =
Reading and instruction: Installation
Verification: You should see a "Crystal" menu in Eclipse.

= 2. Register your analysis =
Reading and instruction: GettingStarted (don't bother with the ASTVisitor yet, just get an ICrystalAnalysis registered).
Verification: Start a child Eclipse. Your analysis name will appear under the Crystal menu.

= 3. Create a visitor = 
Reading and instruction: GettingStarted (now make a visitor too!)
Verification: Start the child Eclipse and run your analysis.

= 4. Create a flow analysis = 
Reading and instruction: DataflowAnalysis (don't override any transfer functions, but get everything put together and have the visitor call to the flow analysis.)
Verification: Start the child Eclipse and run your analysis. It will give the same results as for the above step, since your flow analysis isn't transferring yet.

= 5. Start making those transfer functions smart! =
Reading and instruction: DataflowAnalysis (add in those transfer functions now)
Verification: Start the child Eclipse, you should now have a smarter analysis!

= 6. Create annotations =

= 7. Use the annotations =

= 8. Switch to a branch-sensitive analysis =
