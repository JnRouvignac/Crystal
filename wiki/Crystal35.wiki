We released Crystal 3.5 in May 2011.  You can install it from Crystal's eclipse update site (see Installation), browse the Javadoc or go to the source.


= Release Notes =

Crystal 3.5 comes with a few improvements and API changes:
  * You can run Crystal on .class files with source attachment (requires a small interface change that should be transparent to most users).
  * Installing the [http://code.google.com/p/plaidannotations planno] Eclipse plugin is no longer required (but needed for Crystal's analysis test feature).
  * You can hit F6 to run Crystal on the .java file in the current Eclipse editor.
