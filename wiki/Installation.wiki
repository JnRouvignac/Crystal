You can use Subversion to check out the CrystalPlugin module from this repository.  CrystalPlugin is an Eclipse plug-in project that you should add to your Eclipse workspace.  (If you are checking out through Eclipse it will offer to add the project automatically to your workspace.)  Create a "Run Configuration" for an "Eclipse Application" and make sure "edu.cmu.cs.crystal" is among the loaded Plug-ins.  Running the application will open a second Eclipse window, called the _child eclipse_, in which Crystal is loaded.
