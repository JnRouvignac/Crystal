= Eclipse update site =

The easiest way to install Crystal is to update your existing Eclipse installation.  Use the following update site and follow the instructions.

[http://crystalsaf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/EclipseUpdate/]

The Crystal plugin also *requires* the Plaid Annotations plugin, available at the following update site:

[http://plaidannotations.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PlaidAnnotationsUpdateSite/] 

== Eclipse 3.4 ==

  # Select Help -> Software Updates... from the main menu.
  # Switch to the "Available Software" page.
  # Use "Add site" to add the Crystal update site (if not already present)
  # Check "Crystal Static Analysis Framework" from the list of update sites
  # Click the "Install..." button and follow the instructions.

Eclipse will automatically download and install Crystal.

= Source installation =

You can use Subversion to check out the !CrystalPlugin module from this repository.  !CrystalPlugin is an Eclipse plug-in project that you should add to your Eclipse workspace.  (If you are checking out through Eclipse it will offer to add the project automatically to your workspace.)  Create a "Run Configuration" for an "Eclipse Application" and make sure "edu.cmu.cs.crystal" is among the loaded Plug-ins.  Running the application will open a second Eclipse window, called the _child eclipse_, in which Crystal is loaded.  When using Crystal sources (which include the annotations), you may still need the annotation Jar from the "Downloads" area to build code in the child eclipse.

= Troubleshooting =
  * Note that if you intend to build Crystal from source, you must have certain Eclipse plug-ins such as [http://www.eclipse.org/pde/ PDE] and [http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ JDT]. These plugins do not come with every Eclipse package. In particular, they do not come with "Eclipse for Java Developers." We recommend using either "Eclipse Classic" or "Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers."
